Certain character in bash has special meaning, quoting removes the special power of these special characters.


Three types of quoting can be done in bash:
1. backslash(\) -Removes special meaning of next character
2. Single quote -Removes special meaning if all the character inside single brackets.
3. Double quote -Removes special meaning of all characters except with $ sign and backtick(`)

eg.
echo Jack \& Joans   Removes spacial power of & symbol
filename="C:\Users\\$USER\DOCUMENTS"
